## üåå Gameplay & Combat Systems

* **Precision Laser Combat:** Multi-laser weapon systems with particle-based projectiles that respond to mouse-aimed targeting for tactical engagement.
* **Dynamic Crosshair Targeting:** Real-time mouse-to-world positioning creates intuitive aiming mechanics with visual feedback through UI crosshair integration.
* **Enemy Engagement:** Multi-hit enemy system with customizable health pools and destruction sequences that reward tactical shooting and persistence.
* **Collision-Based Challenges:** Environmental hazards and enemy contact create immediate consequences, demanding skillful navigation and combat awareness.

## üéØ Player Experience & Feedback

* **Visual Destruction System:** Instantiated VFX for enemy and player destruction provides immediate, satisfying feedback for all combat interactions.
* **Score-Driven Progression:** Point-based enemy values encourage strategic target prioritization and reward skillful play with clear numerical feedback.
* **Responsive UI Integration:** Real-time score updates and crosshair positioning create seamless interface that enhances rather than interrupts gameplay.
* **Cursor Management:** Hidden system cursor with custom crosshair creates immersive targeting experience without desktop interface distractions.

## üìù Reflections

Building **Galaxy Strike** has been an incredible journey into cinematic game design, combining traditional rail shooter mechanics with modern Unity systems. The integration of Timeline for narrative sequences with real-time combat creates a unique experience that balances player agency with directed storytelling.

The project demonstrates advanced Unity techniques including Timeline integration, sophisticated input handling, and complex particle system management. The modular architecture allows for easy expansion with new enemy types, weapon systems, and environmental challenges while maintaining clean, maintainable code that supports rapid iteration and creative experimentation.

The combination of precise aiming mechanics, dynamic flight controls, and cinematic presentation creates an engaging space combat experience that showcases both technical proficiency and creative game design vision.
